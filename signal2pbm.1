.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\fBsignal2pbm\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fIdatafile\fP [\fIoutfile.pbm\fP]

.
.
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Plot a sequence of integers stored sequentially in a file.
Produce a pbm(5) image file as a result.

.
.
.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI -w " width
the width of the image, in pixels;
the height depends on the number of samples
.TP
.BI -t " timeslot
how many samples are drawn in an horizontal pixel;
all values between the minimal value and maximal value in the slot are drawn,
not just the values that are actually sampled within the time slot; if
\fItimeslot\fP is zero or negative, each sample is replicated \fI-timeslot+2\fP
times
.TP
.BI -m " maxvalue
the maximal value for the signal; by default, it is \fIINT16_MAX\fP, the
maximal possible value for a signed 16-bit integer; this option can be used to
expand the signal, like \fI-e\fP; if a value is larger than the maximal value,
it is drawn cropped
.TP
.BI -i " interline
the output images has the signal drawn in a sequence of lines;
this amount tells how much pixels each line has below and above;
the default is 10, meaning that lines are 20 pixels apart
.TP
.BI -e " factor
how much to expand each line; if \fIfactor\fP is more than one (the default),
the signal is drawn cropped when it would be larger than half the interline; in
other words, the drawing never invades the lines above and below
.TP
.BI -s " threshold
amounts lower than this are considered null as far as the no-signal line
squeezing is concerned (see option \fI-n\fP)
.TP
.BI -n " height
flat lines are squeezed to save space; this is their height;
to suppress squeezing, set \fIheight\fP to be double the interline
.TP
.B -j
without this option, a jump between signal values at consecutive points is
connected; this option disables this; as a result, the signal line may be shown
as broken
.TP
.B -a
normally, all points between minimum and maximal level in the timeslot are
drawn; this option makes the average being drawn instead; this average is
likely to be uniformly zero
.TP
.B -0
draw the line of signal level 0 in addition to the actual signal level
.TP
.B -f
input is a sequence of numbers in ascii, one per line;
the default is a 1-channel 16-bit linear PCM AU file with header
.TP
.B -v
run the fbi(1) viewer to show the resulting image; does not work at the end of
a pipe, since the viewer needs the standard input to come from a console
.TP
.B -h
in-line help
.TP
.B outfile.pbm
output file; \fIoutput.pbm\fP, if omitted
